## **Week 1:**
- I learned what was Discrete Mathematics all about, and the first lesson is all about logic and proofs.
 * In logic and proofs, proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
 * Logical deduction is a process of reasoning from one or more statements which reach to a conclusion.
 * Axiom of Equality - a statement that is already accepted. | ex: a+c = b+c |
 * There are also different types of truth which depends to its beholder
    * Legal truth - decided by a judge
    * Authorative truth - specified by a trusted person
    * Scientific truth - confirmed by an experiment
    * Probable truth - established by statistical analysis
    * Philosophical proof - careful exposition and persuasion
    * **Mathematical truth - what we use in DISMATH**
         * Proposition is a declarative statement.
            * Example (which was given in our class): "Shun will be successful." ← we can declare this.
 * Logical connectives 
      * Negation - "not" (¬)
      * Conjunction - "and" (∧)
      * Disjunction - "or" (v)
      * Exclusive Or - "x or" (⊕)
      * Conditional - "if, then" (→)
      * Biconditional - "iff" (↔)
* Propositional Variables 
	* Ex: p and q
* Truth Table lists all the possible combination of the input with their corresponding output.

| Input (q) | Output (¬q) |
| --------- | ---------- |
| T | F |
| F | T |

* Conjunction (p ∧ q) - True iff p and q are true.

| p | q | p ∧ q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| T | F | F |
| T | T | T |

* Disjunction (p v q) - False iff p and q are false.

| p | q | p v q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| T | T | T |

* Exlusive Or (p ⊕ q) - p or q but not both.

| p | q | p ⊕ q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| T | T | F |

* Conditional Statement (p → q) - if p, then q.

| p | q | p → q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F | F | T |
| F | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| T | T | T |

* Biconditional (p ↔ q) - p iff q.

| p | q | p ↔ q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F | F | T |
| F | T | F |
| T | F | F |
| T | T | T |

## *Week 2:*

- This week, we learned about proof using logical equivalences
 * Logical Equivalences are compound propositions that have the same truth values in all possible cases.

| Equivalences | Name |
| --- | --- |
| p ∧ T ≡ p | Identity Laws|
| p v F ≡ p |  |
