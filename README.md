## **Week 1:**
- I learned what was Discrete Mathematics all about, and the first lesson is all about logic and proofs.
- This is what I learned for this week:
 * In logic and proofs, proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
 * Logical deduction is a process of reasoning from one or more statements which reach to a conclusion.
 * Axiom of Equality - a statement that is already accepted.
   | a+c = b+c |
