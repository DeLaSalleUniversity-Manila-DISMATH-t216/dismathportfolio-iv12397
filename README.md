## **Week 1:**
- I learned what was Discrete Mathematics all about, and the first lesson is all about logic and proofs.
 * In logic and proofs, proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
 * Logical deduction is a process of reasoning from one or more statements which reach to a conclusion.
 * Axiom of Equality - a statement that is already accepted. | ex: a+c = b+c |
 * There are also different types of truth which depends to its beholder
    * Legal truth - decided by a judge
    * Authorative truth - specified by a trusted person
    * Scientific truth - confirmed by an experiment
    * Probable truth - established by statistical analysis
    * Philosophical proof - careful exposition and persuasion
    * **Mathematical truth - what we use in DISMATH**
         * Proposition is a declarative statement.
            * Example (which was given in our class): "Shun will be successful." ← we can declare this.
 * Logical connectives 
      * Negation - "not" (¬)
      * Conjunction - "and" (∧)
      * Disjunction - "or" (v)
      * Exclusive Or - "x or" (⊕)
      * Conditional - "if, then" (→)
      * Biconditional - "iff" (↔)
